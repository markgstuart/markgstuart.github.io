## Welcome to Mark's GitHub homepage

Over time, I plan to develop my understanding of coding through GitHub, with the aim of gathering an understanding of Python to support my work in manipulating and pulling data from Facebook's API.

My journey will be captured and shared on this page so you can follow my journey. I'd greatly appreciate any support on my journey, so please critique my work as you see fit - I feel this will be a steep learning curve, but one I'm extremely passionate about undertaking. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/markgstuart/markgstuart.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
