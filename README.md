## Welcome to Mark's GitHub homepage

Over time, I plan to develop my understanding of coding through GitHub, with the aim of gathering an understanding of Python to support my work in manipulating and pulling data from Facebook's API.

My journey will be captured and shared on this page so you can follow my journey. I'd greatly appreciate any support on my journey, so please critique my work as you see fit - I feel this will be a steep learning curve, but one I'm extremely passionate about undertaking.
